## Ranked Projects

### Best School Work
These are the top academic projects I've worked on. I’ve left a lot out, but here’s the most notable:

1. **Bastion Health LLM**  
   This project doubled as an internship, where I worked with large language models to enhance healthcare solutions. One of my proudest achievements. 
   
2. **Crime App**  
   A robust application designed for tracking and reporting criminal activities, utilizing various data sources for real-time updates.

3. **Java Movie Database (Coming Soon)**  
   A complex project in development, focusing on managing and querying a large dataset of movies with various features.

### Coding for Fun Projects
These are projects I work on in my free time. They are more for personal growth and fun, so don’t judge them too harshly!

1. **Chrome Extension**  
   A custom Chrome extension that enhances the browsing experience by providing useful tools and features.

2. **Spotify Playlist Automater**  
   A tool to automate playlist generation and management on Spotify, using their public API.
   I'm thinking about making this into payed software, so to any potential employers I will send you the video of everything working, and some code snippets.
   But I don't want this public because it took days to get this working

4. **Password Manager**  
   A local password manager built with SQLite for secure storage and management of passwords.

5. **Discord Mod**  
   A Discord bot designed to assist in moderating servers with various commands and automation features.

6. **Other Projects**  
   Projects like Forza telemetry analysis and personal tax automation tools have been removed from the list to keep the focus on my more time-consuming and significant projects.
