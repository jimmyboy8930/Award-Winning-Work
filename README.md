## Ranked Projects

### Best School Work
These are the top academic projects I've worked on. I’ve left a lot out, but here’s the most notable:

1. **Bastion Health LLM**  
   This project doubled as an internship, where I worked with large language models to enhance healthcare solutions. One of my proudest achievements. 

2. **Java Movie Database**  
   A complex project in development, focusing on managing and querying a large dataset of movies with various features.

3. **Crime App**  
   A robust application designed for tracking and reporting criminal activities, utilizing various data sources for real-time updates.

4. **Personal Portfolio Website (In development)**  
   This is a mix of school work and for fun work. It is my most complex web project, using PHP to query SQL database. Other languages include HTML, CSS and Java script, with room to add more. This is also utilizing the most modern cybersecurity measures like cookies, hashes, certificate from letsencrypt.org, headers, etc. all defined by me.

### Coding for Fun Projects
These are projects I work on in my free time. They are more for personal growth and fun, so don’t judge them too harshly!

1. **Chrome Extension**  
   A custom Chrome extension that enhances the browsing experience by providing useful tools and features.

2. **Spotify Playlist Automater (Potential Paid Software)**  
   This tool automates playlist generation and management on Spotify using their public API. While there's no frontend yet (only terminal messages), I am considering making this into     paid software due to the backend quality exceeding that of some paid websites I've explored (improved search functionality).  
   - **Note to Employers**: If you're interested, I will provide a video demonstration of the tool in action, along with some code snippets. For now, this project remains private.

4. **Password Manager**  
   A local password manager built with SQLite for secure storage and management of passwords.

5. **Discord Mod**  
   A Discord bot designed to assist in moderating servers with various commands and automation features.

6. **Other Projects**  
   Projects like Forza telemetry analysis and personal tax automation tools have been removed from the list to keep the focus on my more time-consuming and significant projects.
